Hello There! I am Faiz, a penultimate Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore. My areas of interest include Web Development, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Cybersecurity. I love using technology to make everyday life easier:  I even built a telebot with my friends to keep ourselves accountable to solve Leetcode questions everyday! The need for tech is vast, and Iâ€™m excited to learn about it and put tech to good use!
