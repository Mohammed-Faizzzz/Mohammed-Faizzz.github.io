## [LeetCode Tracker](https://github.com/Mohammed-Faizzzz/Leetcode_Tracker)

Built a Telegram Bot using the Telegram API, connected it to the LeetCode API to retrieve daily code submissions by a group of friends, keeping us accountable to complete 2 LeetCode questions a day. The code was hosted on Heroku to send timely reminders to those yet to meet their daily quota and to congratulate those who have.

Plans include making it widely available to test demand, and implementing features such as streaks and leaderboards among friend groups. Depending on demand, there are intentions to develop a full-fledged application as well.

## [SmarTix](https://github.com/Mohammed-Faizzzz/SmarTix)

Our submission for NUS Fintech Hackathon 2024 (Semi-Finalists) and LifeHack 2024, where the theme was security. SmarTix is an app aimed to minimize scalping and scamming of concert tickets, a common issue during popular acts such as Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. We used techniques such as sending an OTP to a phone number to verify a new user, since phone numbers are not as easily disposable as emails. Transactions would be recorded on a local private Blockchain, leveraging its immutability to prevent scamming. We also used QR code scanning to record attendance, confirming that the tickets of that user existed on our platform, thus minimizing the risk of selling tickets on the black market. Built using React.js, Firebase, and Solidity for Smart Contracts.

## [Legalbot](https://github.com/Mohammed-Faizzzz/MerLawyer)

A summer project in progress. It is an LLM built on top of a pre-trained transformer model, specializing in the Legal Domain in the Singaporean context. Initially aimed to assist in finding relevant precedents, we are also exploring the incorporation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for up-to-date information. Once the model shows satisfactory responses, we intend to build a legal copilot/autocomplete feature to assist in filling legal documents, streamlining the work for legal staff.

## [ML Insurance](https://github.com/MustafaAH10/MLInsurance)

Our entry for NUS Fintech Hackathon 2023, where we ended up as Semi-Finalists. Built a recommendation Machine Learning model based on Decision Tree Classifiers. The model would recommend insurance policies based on metrics such as age, lifestyle habits, and other relevant factors.

## [SG Enable Health Portal](https://github.com/MustafaAH10/hackforgood)

Built a prototype Patient-Doctor matching portal to match doctors and patients based on patient needs and doctor expertise. Our product was intended to make healthcare more accessible for patients, allowing them to be more independent by removing the middleman required to bring them to doctors and bringing the doctors to them instead. We also intended to leverage doctors who might have free time. Built using HTML and PHP.

## Autonomous Drone

Working on using a Raspberry Pi 4 to automate routes taken by a DJI Tello Drone, essentially removing the need for human control except for charging/uncharging.
