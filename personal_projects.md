## LeetCode Tracker

Built a Telegram Bot using Telegram API. Connected it to Leetcode API to retrieve daily code submissions by group of friends and keep us accountable to complete 2 Leetcode questions a day. Code was hosted on Heroku to send timely reminders to those yet to meet daily quota and also congratulate those who have.

Plan to make it widely available to test demand, and implement features such as streaks and leaderboard among friend groups. Based on demand, intend to code an application as well.

## SmarTix

Our submission for NUS Fintech Hackathon 2024 (Semi-Finalists) and LifeHack 2024, where the theme was security. SmarTix is an app aimed to minimise scalping and scamming of concert tickets, often seen during popular acts such as Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. We used techniques such as sending an OTP to a phone number to verify a new user (Phone numbers are not as readily available as emails). Transactions would be recorded on a local private Blockchain, leveraging its immutability and preventing scamming. We also used QR code scanning features to record attendance, which would confirm that the tickets of that user existed on our platform, minimising risk of selling tickets on a black market. Built using React.js, Firebase, and Solidity for Smart Contracts.

## Legalbot
Summer Project in progress. An LLM built on top of pre-trained transformer model, specialising in the Legal Domain in the Singaporean Context. Initially aimed to only be a LLM to help find relevant precedents, we are also looking into possibly incorporating RAG for up-to-date information. Once model shows satisfactory responses, we also intend to build a legal copilot/autocomplete to fill legal documents so that Legal Staff's work can be more streamlined.

## ML Insurance

Our entry for NUS Fintech Hackathon 2023, where we ended up as Semi-Finalists. Built a recommendation Machine Learning model based on Decision Tree Classifiers. Model would recommend Insurance policies based on metrics such as Age, Lifestyle habits, etc.

## SG Enable Health Portal
Built a prototype Patient-Doctor matching portal to match doctors and patients based on patient needs and doctor expertise. Our product was intended to make healthcare more accessible for patients, and allowing them to be more independent, essentially removing the middleman required to bring them to doctors and bringing the doctors to them instead. We also intended to leverage doctors who might have free time. Built using HTML and PHP.

## Autonomous Drone
Working on using a Raspberry Pi 4 to automate routes taken by DJI Tello Drone, essentially removing the need for human control except for charging/uncharging.
