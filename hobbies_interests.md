I enjoy watching F1 race weekends! I am a big fan of reigning F1 World Champion Max Verstappen. His competitive spirit and deep passion for the sport appeals to me. F1 also involves a diverse range of strategies employed by teams and drivers, on and off the track, to gain the slightest edge over their competitors - it amazes me how competition often breeds innovation. As for sports that I play, the six years playing cricket for my school team taught me valuable life skills like teamwork and resilience, which I carry into my professional life.

An adrenaline junkie at heart, I love pushing my limits through activities like scuba diving and go-karting. I also plan to try paragliding, surfing, and skydiving in the near future. These experiences not only provide thrills but also build my confidence and courage. Furthermore, by constantly stepping out of my comfort zone, I have the opportunity to consistently redefine the boundaries of my comfort zone, broadening it. My friends and I often introduce each other to new hobbies, and Iâ€™m excited to soon try rollerblading and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. We even plan group adventures like climbing Mount Bromo!

I also cherish solo trips, having explored places like Bali and Rome. These journeys foster my independence, enhance my communication skills, and allow me to form lifelong friendships. Solo travel has been instrumental in my personal growth, giving me the confidence to embrace new challenges.
